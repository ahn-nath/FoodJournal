### _Track your eating habits, reflect today_

![Featured image](./featured_.png)



The _Food Journal Tracker_ app is an Android mobile application that can be used to capture photos and information about what you eat. Keeping track of the food you eat is a proven way to make better diet choices. As an added benefit, many popular mobile apps - including Instagram - work in a similar way to the food journaling app. 

  - The user can take a photo of whatever they’re eating or drinking using their phone’s inbuilt camera.
  - The user can then add a description of the food to accompany the photo.
  - The user can browse through all the photos and descriptions they’ve added by swiping up or down.

You can also:
  - Import and save files from your phone local storage or gallery.
  - Delete and update journals.
  - Filter by category.

Remember what you've been eating in the last few days and identify healthy and unhealthy eating patterns.
